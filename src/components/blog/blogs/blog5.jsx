            <p>
            Apple nachos are a fun treat for kids and adults alike. With a creamy peanut butter drizzle, chocolate chips in every bite and a light sprinkle of coconut, this healthy snack is both nutritious and delicious. The peanut butter isn’t just there for flavor. It adds 9grams of protein per serving to keep you full longer.
            <br /><br />
            With just 4 ingredients, this healthy apple nachos recipe is fast and easy to make. It comes together in under 10 minutes and is very kid friendly, since it only takes a few simple ingredients and steps. My 5 year old helped me make it and did all of the chocolate chip sprinkling with only a few sample bites in between. Little ones will need help cutting the apples, microwaving and navigating the steps in between but an older kid could manage this healthy apple recipe from start to finish.

            Apple nachos are just as good for events as they are for a quick after school snack. They’re a nice healthy, yet sweet, option for game day and would be excellent alongside all of the usual savory appetizers served on Super Bowl Sunday. If you’re bringing them to an event or expect them to sit out and not be devoured right away, make sure to soak the apples in lemon juice to avoid browning. This way, your apple nacho leftovers will last up to 3 days in the refrigerator.

            <h2>How to Make Apple Nachos</h2>
            <br />
            <img src={blog__5_1} alt="" />
            <br />
            I used Fuji apples in this recipe but Cosmic Crisp, Gala, Honeycrisp, Granny Smith or pretty much any one of your favorite Stemilt apples will work here. Choose your favorite or whatever you have on hand and let’s get started.
            <br />
            <ol>
              <li>First and foremost, slice those apples thin! ¼” is ideal.</li>
              <li>Soaking in lemon water is entirely optional but recommended if you’ll be snacking on the apples over time and not devouring immediately. Just make sure to dry them off well or the excess water will run off on your serving plate and look messy.</li>
              <li>We chose to lay the apples in an overlapping circle formation which is easy and functional but you can make it into a layered square or even a tree shape, as shown in the holiday options section.</li>
              <li>Microwave that peanut butter! If you have an exceptionally runny peanut butter you may be able to skip this step but for most, this step is essential. The peanut butter will cool quickly so do this after the apples are laid out and ready to go.</li>
              <li>And now its time for the fun stuff. Drizzle that peanut butter all over the apples. Doing it in a zig-zag pattern all around ensures that no apples are left untouched.</li>
              <li>Now sprinkle with chocolate chips, coconut or whatever else sounds good to you and serve right away.</li>
            </ol>
            <br />
            <h2>Variations</h2>
            <br />
           
            While apples with peanut butter and chocolate is always a winning combo, there are many different variations and twists you can try for this fun snack. Since caramel apples are notoriously hard to eat, making caramel apple nachos delivers the same flavor without the need to bite through a thick layer of hardened caramel. Here are some of our other favorite toppings:
            <br />
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>Caramel sauce</li>
              <li>Melted chocolate (white, milk or dark)</li>
              <li>Granola</li>
              <li>Toasted nuts (slivered almonds, crushed pecans, etc.)</li>
              <li>Mini marshmallows</li>
              <li>Butterscotch or peanut butter chips</li>
              <li>Raisins or other dried fruit</li>
              <li>Candy sprinkles</li>
              <li>Small candies</li>
              <li>Blueberries</li>
              <li>Hemp hearts</li>
              <li>Sunflower seeds</li>
              <li>Cinnamon</li>
              <li>Switch out the peanut butter for almond butter</li>
              
            </ul>
            <br />

            If you have a specific diet, you can easily customize the recipe to fit your needs too. Here are some ideas:
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>For a peanut allergy or to make the recipe Paleo compliant, sub with almond or sun butter.</li>
              <li>Vegan? Just make sure you’re using dairy free chocolate chips.</li>
              <li>If you’re gluten free, you’re in luck! The recipe is okay for you to eat as is. Just make sure any extra toppings are gluten free.</li>
            </ul>

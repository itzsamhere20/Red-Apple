            If you find yourself reaching for the sweet stuff during the holidays, you’re not alone. A recent study found that over 50% of Americans admit to foregoing their regular diets around the holidays. However, the vast majority of people from the same group reported that this indulgence during the happiest season of all was of no worry to them. While it’s true that some early adaptations of healthier sweets and snacks left much to be desired, there are plenty of amazing health-conscious treats to add to your holiday feast if you’re looking to keep your diet game going through the season. 
            
            <br />
            <span>Vegan Chocolate Truffles</span>
            <br />

            <br />
            
            Ditch the heavy cream and substitute healthy coconut milk when making these delectable dark chocolate truffles. These handheld, snackable goodies are perfect for your upcoming holiday party and are super simple to make in a pinch. 
            <br />

            <br />
            <span>Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies</span>
            <br />
            <img src={blog__6_3} alt="" />
            <br />
            
            Nothing beats a warm, gooey chocolate chip cookie during the holidays. Substituting oil for butter keeps these plant-based treats easily accessible and even easier to make. You might even fool some of your non-vegan friends. Santa approves, and so do we! 
            <br />

            <br />
            <span>Apple-Cranberry Crisp</span>
            <br />
            <img src={blog__6_4} alt="" />
            <br />
           
            Think deconstructed apple pie with an elevated twist. This fall-friendly crisp gives you that warm, cozy apple base and dusts it with fresh cranberries, chopped walnuts, and healthy oats. Curl up with a bowl of this by the fire, and there will be no doubt that the holidays are in full swing. 
            <br />

            <br />
            <span>Dark Chocolate Dipped Bananas</span>
            <br />
            <img src={blog__6_5} alt="" />
            <br />
            
            Why don’t we just dip every fruit in dark chocolate? Bananas are a great source of potassium and have a wide array of health benefits. Paired with a high-quality dark chocolate, these frozen treats will have you making non-stop trips to the freezer all throughout the holidays. 
            <br />

            <br />
            <span>White Chocolate Dipped Orange Slices</span>
            <br />
            <img src={blog__6_6} alt="" />
            <br />
            
            Not to be confused with the bananas above, this recipe takes oven-dried orange slices and dips them in smooth white chocolate. The burst of fresh citrus flavors mixed with the sweetness of the chocolate makes this after-dinner treat equal parts light and refreshing. 
            <br />

            <br />
            <span>Almond Milk Hot Chocolate</span>
            <br />
            <img src={blog__6_7} alt="" />
            <br />
            
            Don’t leave home for Christmas tree shopping without a cup of this easy-to-make hot chocolate. Heat up one cup of unsweetened almond milk in a microwave with your favorite square of high-quality dark chocolate and stir. Yes, it’s that easy. 
            <br />

            <br />
            <br />
            And if you choose to cheat on your diet during the holidays, that’s fine! As always, moderation is the key to living a happy, healthy lifestyle. Enjoy your time with family and friends, and you can’t go wrong!

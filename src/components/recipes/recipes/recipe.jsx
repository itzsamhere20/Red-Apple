                    <br />
                    In a large bowl, whisk flour, granulated sugar, and salt. (Alternatively, you can use a food processor.) Add butter and, using your hands, mix until walnut-sized pieces form. Add vinegar, then ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and mix until dough starts to come together and is slightly crumbly and moist, but not wet and sticky (test by squeezing some with your fingers).

                    Turn out dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Divide into 2 balls. Flatten into disks (making sure there are no/minimal cracks). Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until dough is very cold, at least 2 hours or up to overnight.

                    <br />
                    In a large skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Cook apples, granulated sugar, apple butter, vanilla, and salt, stirring occasionally, until apples begin to soften, 4 to 5 minutes.

                    <br />
                    In a small bowl, whisk lemon juice into cornstarch, then add to skillet and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture slightly thickens, about 1 minute. Transfer to a large bowl; cover and refrigerate until cold, at least 30 minutes or up to overnight.

                    Preheat oven to 400Â°. Let dough sit at room temperature 5 to 10 minutes. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. In a small bowl, whisk egg, water, and salt until combined.

                    On a lightly floured work surface, roll each disk to a 16" round. Using a 6" round cookie cutter (or a bowl 6" in diameter), cut out 3 circles from each round.

                        <b>Step 1</b>
                    <br />
                    Preheat oven to 425Â° and place racks in the center and upper third of the oven. In a small bowl, whisk olive oil, balsamic, maple syrup, mustard, and Â¼ teaspoon each salt and pepper.

                        <b>Step 2</b>
                    <br />
                    Add onion and apple to a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with half of the balsamic mixture and toss to combine. Season with Â¼ teaspoon each salt and pepper.

                        <b>Step 3</b>
                    <br />
                    Season the pork chops on both sides with 1 teaspoon salt and Â¼ teaspoon pepper. Nestle the pork chops among the onions and apples. Brush the remaining half of the balsamic mixture on both sides of each chop. Top each chop with a rosemary sprig. Place in the center rack of the oven and bake until apples and onions are softened, about 15 minutes.

                        <b>Step 4</b>
                    <br />
                    Increase oven temperature to a high broil. Discard rosemary and place the sheet pan on the rack in the upper third of your oven and broil until chops are slightly caramelized, 3 to 5 minutes, depending on the strength of your broiler. Let pork rest at least 5 minutes before slicing. Serve pork with apples and onions with any pan juices spooned over top.
